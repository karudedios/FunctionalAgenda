#Functional Agenda

### Description
This is a repository made to see how it works in a *pseudo-real-life* application, built from top to bottom using libraries made by myself [FunctionalProgrammingUtilities](https://github.com/karudedios/FunctionalProgrammingUtilities) and [FunctionalProgramming.js](https://github.com/karudedios/FunctionalProgramming.js).

What I'm going to be doing here is mostly testing how they work, spotting bugs that no unit-test can find and checking them out in real usage pretty much.

Plus taking to opportunity to learn to work with [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) and [JSPM](https://github.com/jspm).
